# sneakersClassifier
Data and Code to Classify sneakers into their respective brands

The sneaker classifier project is a deep learning project that aims to classify sneakers based on their images. The dataset for this project has been collected from popular ecommerce websites and includes images of sneakers from various brands and styles. The project uses Keras with TensorFlow as the backend to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to classify the sneakers.

After multiple iterations of testing, the hyperparameters for the CNN model have been set to achieve the best possible accuracy. The model has been trained on a combination of training, testing, and validation data, with the goal of accurately classifying new sneakers that are not in the original dataset.

The project can be used as a starting point for similar image classification projects and can be extended to classify other types of products. The code for this project is available on GitHub for anyone to use and modify for their own purposes.
